# LandLordGame
## The team project for CS3343 
Developed a 3-man LandLord Game

## First Version
This Version is operated in Command Line
Once you run it, the system will ask you firstly enter into 3 player's name 
After that each of the player will give out their cards in turn. 
However, by now we haven't made the other player's cards invisible which this function will be added in next few versions.
And after you enter into the name, the system will tell each player how many cards you have and you should type the cards which you want to give out in a stream. And follow the system's instructions.

## Second Version

This version fixed the bugs on pokercontrol and make the input control function more robust.  

## Final Version

Fixed all the bugs in the whole program. Corrected the error on the situation that two other players can't give out cards.
