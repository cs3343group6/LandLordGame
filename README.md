# LandLordGame
## The team project for CS3343 
Developed a 3-man LandLord Game

## First Version
This Version is operated in Command Line
Once you run it, the system will ask you firstly enter into 3 player's name 
After that each of the player will give out their cards in turn. 
However, by now we haven't made the other player's cards invisible which this function will be added in next few versions.
And after you enter into the name, the system will tell each player how many cards you have and you should type the cards which you want to give out in a stream. And follow the system's instructions.

## Second Version

This version fixed the bugs on pokercontrol and make the input control function more robust.  

## Final Version

Fixed all the bugs appeared in the whole program. Corrected the error on the situation that two other players can't give out cards.

## Player's Guide

During this game, there are three players and for the first round, each player should  type in their names. During each player's turn, the system will show all the cards he owned and displayed them on the screen. The first number of each Poker is their category. The second is the type of the card. You just need to type out the cards you want to give out. *REMEMBER* you need to add a space in the middle of two different cards. After typing in the cards, the system will give out the reminder to see if you have been successfully given out the card. If so, your card list will make an update. And the result will be shown on the screen again.
